#+TITLE: Linux course presentations

This repository contains a basic presentation series for my university.
The course aims to cover the basic, essential topics of Linux and to explain my own experiences with it.

Above all, this repository is a playground for me to test out LaTeX and Beamer features.

I welcome contributions of any sort!

** Keeping it consistent

- Everything other than the slides context must be in English. (Eventually, I will translate the slides.)
- All the generic files are Org files.
- Common properties and commands must be written in `src/header.tex`. (no other shared file with the current `compiler.sh`. If you aim to add more, modify the file as well.)
- In Preamble, the settings of each package should be directly below it.
- Logical sections of the codes should follow the syntax below (example used in `src/header.tex`):
  #+BEGIN_SRC
-----
BEGIN Section
-----

code

-----
END Section
-----
  #+END_SRC

-----
Yet figuring it out!
